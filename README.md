# Web SSH, SCP, SFTP client.

## An attempt to replicate [File-UI](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~qy44/fileui/) on the web.

### What I want to achieve with CloudFTP 1.0

* Login to a SSH/FTP server
* Show directory list with detail
* Download file from server to local
* Upload file from local to server

#### [Work demo] (https://cloudftp.emz.us/cloudftp/#LOGIN) (Work in Progress, will have bugs)
#### Credentials {'hostname': 'cloudftpdemo@ssh.emz.us',  'password': 'cloudftpdemo'}
